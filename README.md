# ScribeSync

## Overview
ScribeSync aims to bridge handwriting and digital workflows, transforming devices like the Kindle Scribe into an extension of digital planning and productivity.

### Core Goals
- **Bridge Handwriting + Digital Workflows**: Integrate the Kindle Scribe into the digital ecosystem seamlessly.
- **Create Low-Friction Sync Points**: Allow users to mark specific pages for sync, using a ScribeSync logo and checkbox for selection.
- **Train Better Hybrid Habits**: Foster workflows for those who prefer paper but live in a digital environment.
- **AI-Powered Text Extraction**: Utilize AI to understand handwritten text and create Events, Tasks, To-Do Lists, and integrate with Gmail/Google services, and later with Outlook/MS services.

### Key Features
- **Smart Sync Marker**: A consistent icon on each page helps users indicate which pages to sync.
- **Multi-Zone Sync**: Extract different items to various types: Events, Tasks, To-Do Lists, and notes.
- **Gentle Digital Integration**: No change in handwriting style required, just sync smartly into apps like Google Calendar, Outlook, and Notion.
- **Low-Touch Onboarding**: Users authenticate with Google and receive a template PDF Daily Planner, which they can sync easily to their Kindle Scribe.
